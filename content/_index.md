# Hi there.

My name is Lars Kellogg-Stedman (that's */l√§rSH/*). By day I'm a senior principal software engineer at [Red Hat][]; by night I fiddle with software and electronics and I am easily distracted by shiny things. You may know me from [Stack Overflow][] (and a smattering of other [Stack Exchange][] sites), where I like to answer questions on a variety of topics.

[stack exchange]: https://stackexchange.com/users/49492/larsks

I have previously worked at [Harvard University SEAS][seas], [Boston University Dept. of Computer Science][bucs], and the now defunct Boston University Distributed Systems Support Group ("DSG").
