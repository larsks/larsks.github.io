I have an amateur radio [General] class license. My callsign is **N1LKS**. I am interested in packet radio and other digital modes, although I'm not terribly active on that front.

I am the author of the [tm-v71-tools] package, a CLI tool for managing a Kenwood TM-V71 radio.

You can find more information about my radio-related activities at <https://n1lks.oddbit.com/>.
